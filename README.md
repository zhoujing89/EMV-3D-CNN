# EMV-3D-CNN

This repository contains the code of **An Ensemble Multi-View 3D Convolution Neutral Network Model for Lung Adenocarcinoma Risk Stratification on Thin Slice Computed Tomography: A Multi-Center Study**. 

## Introduction

Lung cancer has always been among the most frequently diagnosed cancers threatening peopleâ€™s health worldwide. However, seldom studies predict the invasive grades of lung adenocarcinoma. This is an important task since it will be helpful to design a more reasonable surgical mode (lobectomy or sublobar resection) before operation. We propose an ensemble multi-view 3D convolution neutral network (EMV-3D-CNN) model to comprehensively study the risk grades of lung adenocarcinoma. 

## Model
Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed EMV-3D-CNN model. Our approach consists of three key tasks. They are, respectively, diagnosing benign and malignant lung tumors (Task 1), classifying between pre-invasive and invasive lung tumors (Task 2), and identifying the risk stratification (i.e, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3) of invasive lung tumors (Task 3).

Finally, for user-friendly access, the proposed model is also implemented as a web-based system (https://seeyourlung.com.cn). By uploading the full original CT images of DICOM format, our algorithm can give the risk grades of pulmonary nodules by specifying the center location of the target lung nodule.
