This repository contains the code of **An Ensemble Multi-View 3D Convolution Neutral Network Model for Lung Adenocarcinoma Risk Stratification on Thin Slice Computed Tomography: A Multi-Center Study**. 

## Introduction

Lung cancer has always been among the most frequently diagnosed cancers threatening peopleâ€™s health worldwide. However, seldom studies predict the invasive grades of lung adenocarcinoma. This is an important task since it will be helpful to design a more reasonable surgical mode (lobectomy or sublobar resection) before operation. We propose an ensemble multi-view 3D convolution neutral network (EMV-3D-CNN) model to comprehensively study the risk grades of lung adenocarcinoma. Our model achieves a state-of-art performance (91.3% AUC for diagnosis between benign and malignant, 92.5% AUC for diagnosis between pre-invasive and invasive, and 77.6% accuracy for diagnosis among risks of Grades 1,2,3) on 1,075 lung nodules (covering 627 CT trials) collected from three medical centers. 

## Model Development


Finally, for user-friendly access, the proposed model is also implemented as a web-based system (https://seeyourlung.com.cn). By uploading the full original CT images of DICOM format, our algorithm can give the risk grades of pulmonary nodules by specifying the center location of the target lung nodule.
